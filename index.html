  Hi, this is Sahil. Glad that you're here. Please don't hesitate navigating around. Help yourself with the links in the upper right corner to know more.
  <br><br>
  You may want to check my weekly reports or full summary at the upper right "GSoC 2018" corner. Alternatively, to view the actual code that I wrote/changed, head to the end of the first (GSoC Summary) post on that page. 
  <br><br>
  I made <a href= "https://github.com/me-ydv-5/phoneNum">this</a> open source <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/TextWatcher">textWatcher class</a>
  for android (API >= 16) for Canadian Phone Number format (+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX) sometime back.
  <br><br>
  I also did some work on basic learning of LAMP stack with <a href="https://github.com/me-ydv-5/school-db">this</a> project of School Management Portal.
  Hopefully, I'll be migrating the app to some online DB service (Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora) as soon as I get some time.
  <br><br>
  Lately, I've been helping in maintain the following <a href="https://github.com/royalpranjal/Interview-Bit">InterviewBit solutions repository</a> by writing code, reviewing PRs, etc. 
  It contains solutions for many of the questions on InterviewBit. You are encouraged to contribute to it as well! 
  <br><br>
  I'll keep adding links to other works as and when something is available to be displayed.
