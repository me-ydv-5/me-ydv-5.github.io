Hi Stranger. It's  been quite sometime that I put something in here. So, I came up with this idea of self assessment. I'll be putting up my daily "productive work" here as a post. That way, the site will not become rusty and it will also help me track what and how exactly I need to go with it. In between, I'll also add some relevant and informative text about what I'll be doing in the bounds of "productive work". I'll first start with 7 days demo to see how it goes. Hope I don't miss any of the day and increase my productivity.
