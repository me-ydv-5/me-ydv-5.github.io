Hi! Now that my exams are over, I am back on the track. First evaluation will take place this week. I will continue my work from the last task, i.e, `wiki_login.m`, to complete its implementation and then use it in `publish_to_wiki` function that will help us upload the wiki to user's online wiki. After that I plant to implement the RESTful services part of the project, which has `weboptions` function lined up at first.

I'll update this blog with any subsequent progresses.
