Continuing further, I added more options in `libcurl_wrapper.cc`. As described in earlier posts, the current implementation of `wiki_login.m` has the JAVA's interface to Octave in use and I need to replace it with Octave's own implementation. So, I've taken two steps in this direction. Now a user is able to retrieve token when he executes `wiki_login` AND use the cookies that are set in a temporary `.txt` file to login into the `api.php` wiki. Currently, there's a problem in logging in, because the following cookies are unable to get added, `octave_org_session`, `octave_orgUserID`, `octave_orgUserName`, `octave_orgToken`. I got to know about these cookies when I tried to execute the curl-cli commands for logging in.

I also understood how the `HAVE_CURL` macro encapsulates the `curl_transfer` class, i.e, if curl is available in a machine, then this class exists, else not. `HAVE_CURL` is a macro that is set during `./configure` stage of building the software. I will be extending my work in this class essentially in the coming week.

I've also added the files in their appropriate directories.

A new [dummy wiki](https://wiki.octave.space) has been created by Kai for testing purposes. I'll be using this from now on.
