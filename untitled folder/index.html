  Hi, this is Sahil. Glad that you're here. Please don't hesitate navigating around. Help yourself with the links in the upper right corner to know more.

  I recently made this urlShortner Service which takes a URL and gives back a  shortened URL by calculating the md5 hash for the string URL. It uses postgreSQL, express and node for the backend and Javascript, HTML, CSS
  for the front end. See the project <a href="https://github.com/me-ydv-5/urlShortner">here</a>.

  You may want to check my weekly reports or full summary at the upper right "GSoC 2018" corner. Alternatively, to view the actual code that I wrote/changed, head to the end of the first (GSoC Summary) post on that page.

  I, with one of my seniors, exercised a codesprint lasting a week to learn Node.js, Express.js and React.js and finally resulted in a real time web
  conferencing application using <a href="https://docs.agora.io/en/Video/release_web_video?platform=Web#v2-5-0">Agora Web SDK</a>. It was 
  real fun to work on. Have a look at the project here: <a href= "https://github.com/me-ydv-5/agora-hackathon">Agora Web SDK Application</a>.
  <br><br>
  I made <a href= "https://github.com/me-ydv-5/phoneNum">this</a> open source <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/text/TextWatcher">textWatcher class</a>
  for android (API >= 16) for Canadian Phone Number format (+1 (XXX) XXX-XXXX) sometime back.
  <br><br>
  I also did some work on basic learning of LAMP stack with <a href="https://github.com/me-ydv-5/school-db">this</a> project of School Management Portal.
  Hopefully, I'll be migrating the app to some online DB service (Amazon RDS or Amazon Aurora) as soon as I get some time.
  <br><br>
  Lately, I've been helping in maintain the following <a href="https://github.com/royalpranjal/Interview-Bit">InterviewBit solutions repository</a> by writing code, reviewing PRs, etc. 
  It contains solutions for many of the questions on InterviewBit. You are encouraged to contribute to it as well! 
  <br><br>
  I'll keep adding links to other works as and when something is available to be displayed.
