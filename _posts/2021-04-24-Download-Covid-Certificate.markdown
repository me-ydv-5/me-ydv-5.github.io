Hi There!

If you're struggling to get your Covid Vaccine certificate in your [digilocker](https://digilocker.gov.in/), then here are the steps to help you out.

1.  Go to [cowin.gov.in](https://cowin.gov.in)
2.  Click `Register/Sign In yourself`
3.  Enter your registered mobile number (which you registered while getting the vaccine). **DO NOT** click on `Sign In with AarogyaSetu` or `Sign In with Umang` as that doesn't seem to work.
4.  Once you fill in the otp, you'll see a dashboard that has all the details about your vaccine schedule.
5.  Click on `certificate`.
6.  This will download the vaccine certificate with **BENEFICIARY ID** in it.
7.  Go to [digilocker.gov.in/](https://digilocker.gov.in/) and sign in with your aadhar/registered mobile no.
8.  Go to the `issued documents` tab on the left and click `Get more issued documents`. 
9.  On the new page, on top search bar, write `covid`. Select `Delhi` among the two options.
10.  Paste your Beneficiary ID obtained from Step 6. Click `Get Document`.
11.  There you go, you can now see your covid certificate in Digilocker as well as have a copy from step 6.
