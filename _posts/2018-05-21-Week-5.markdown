With 25th May approaching, I'm confident to say that I've completed my first evaluation (although some grammatical and styling rechecking is left). Now, as directed by Kai, I've implemented the [`wiki_login.m`](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/src/default/scripts/miscellaneous/wiki_login.m) function from using the internals of [`url-transfer.cc/h`](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/src/3fe1c77dfbb320306d228e0cd10608b7f8057165/liboctave/util/url-transfer.cc#lines-731) class. I've scapped the earlier design of implementing `cookie_manager.m` script and `libcurl_wrapper.cc` class for doing the cookie thing and directly implemented [`__wiki_login__`](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/src/3fe1c77dfbb320306d228e0cd10608b7f8057165/libinterp/corefcn/urlwrite.cc#lines-739) as an internal function in `urlwrite.cc`. A user is now able to log into api.php

To test my implemtation:

*   Make a test account on `wiki.octave.space` with username and password of your choice. 
*   `hg clone https://me_ydv_5@bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave`
*   `hg up ocs`

*   `cd path/to/your/build/tree/` and execute `make -jX`

*   `./run-octave`

*   execute `wiki_login ("https://wiki.octave.space/api.php", yourUsername, yourPassword);`

If it is all successful, you should see a prompt `Success: logged in as yourUsername`.

Other than that, I'm really grateful to [jwe](http://jweaton.org/) for moving the `version.h` file to `liboctave` from `libinterp` as this is needed to get the `OCTAVE_VERSION` for the user agent (see week 3 for this).


*NOTE: You may need to re-run `./bootstrap` and `./configure` due to above changes.*

Lastly, I would request to someone who uses Windows (My Windows ran into some problem and I'm now unable to connect to internet, I'll reinstall it whenever I get some time) and/or Mac OS to test my implementation and report any errors.

Needless to say I'm always looking forward to constructive feedback/criticism.
