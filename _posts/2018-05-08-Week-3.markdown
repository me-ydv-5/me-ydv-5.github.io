**UPDATE on 12-May-2018**: You can now directly test my work by cloning my repo, updating the source tree to my bookmark by `hg up ocs`, making a build and calling `wiki_login` from octave-cli to get a login token in return. I've added the files and necessary changes in the codebase itself. There's no directory `ocode` now.

If you happen to already have a build of octave, just do the following:
* `cd path/to/your/source/tree`
*   `hg pull https://me_ydv_5@bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave` in your source tree.
*   `hg up -r 8bbf393`
*   `make -jX` in your build tree.

This will save your time of cloning the entire repo and compiliing.

As mentioned in the previous post, I worked on [_\_publish_wiki_output__.m](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/8141dc41d467cc7c8d48990aefec92bd445f8663) and [publish.m](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/file/74fbe0d91994/scripts/miscellaneous/publish.m) code. The \_\_publish_wiki_output__.m has been added as an internal function in scripts/miscellaneous/private. I skimmed through the parser in publish.m to get a gist of how it actually works. It has three levels of parsing:

1.  Extract the overall structure (paragraphs and code sections).

2.  Parsing the content of a paragraph.

3.  Generate the output of the script code and look after figures produced in code.

****

After that, I studied how the [url-transfer.h](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/file/74fbe0d91994/liboctave/util/url-transfer.h) file is implemented which contains a base class named `base_url_transfer` which has a derived class named `url_transder`. One thing that puzzled me while doing so was, why there has to be a macro [`HAVE_CURL`](https://hg.savannah.gnu.org/hgweb/octave/file/74fbe0d91994/liboctave/util/url-transfer.cc#l220) in order for `curl_transfer` to be defined and why we haven't defined `url_transfer` class itself? I would try to get these doubts solved this week.

The problem of [user agent](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page#Identifying_your_client) was solved by selecting the following user agent:

```text
    GNU Octave/OCTAVE_VERSION (https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ ; help@octave.org) libcurl/LIBCURL_VERSION
```
where OCTAVE_VERSION and LIBCURL_VERSION correspond to the user's octave and libcurl version respectively. [This](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/0a2add3cc5e614ebf1e6d04391a197d85397f7bb?at=ocs#Locs/libcurl_wrapper.ccT184) code precisely does the same for us.

My inteded plan for the wrapper is, make a [cookie_manager.m](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/0a2add3cc5e614ebf1e6d04391a197d85397f7bb?at=ocs#chg-ocs/cookie_manager.m) file that will process the various user options (like verbose output, timeout settings, api.php url, etc.) and pass the values to an internal [\_\_curl__.cc](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/0a2add3cc5e614ebf1e6d04391a197d85397f7bb?at=ocs#chg-ocs/__curl__.cc) function which will in turn, take help from [libcurl_wrapper.cc](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/0a2add3cc5e614ebf1e6d04391a197d85397f7bb?at=ocs#chg-ocs/libcurl_wrapper.cc) to do various tasks (all the work related to cookies will be looked after by it, essentially).

Curently, all the code in [wiki_login.m](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/0a2add3cc5e614ebf1e6d04391a197d85397f7bb?at=ocs#chg-ocs/wiki_login.m) has been commented out except the first step of login, i.e, [getting a login token](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/0a2add3cc5e614ebf1e6d04391a197d85397f7bb?at=ocs#Locs/wiki_login.mT20) from the api.php, which it smoothly does, as of now. I am assuming that the file which would store the cookies, is [temporary](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/0a2add3cc5e614ebf1e6d04391a197d85397f7bb?at=ocs#Locs/cookie_manager.mT9) and should be deleted once the session expires. This is one of the things I will be looking on in this week.

I've migrated all the developments from my forked [git repo](https://github.com/me-ydv-5/octave-web/commits/master) to my mercurial bookmark [`ocs`](https://bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave/commits/branch/ocs) recently and so I was not sure where should I put the files in my source tree. Thus, I've put all of them in a directory `ocode` for now. 

To test this for yourself:
 * Clone my build tree using `hg clone https://me_ydv_5@bitbucket.org/me_ydv_5/octave`
 * Make yourself a build of octave (`make -j2`, etc.). 
 * `cd octave`.  
 * Update to my bookmark using `hg up ocs`. (IMPORTANT!)
 * `cd ocode`.
 * Execute `Makefile` in octave.
 * Execute `wiki_login` in octave to get a login token.

****

All other details of the wrapper's implementation will be followed in the next post.

The next week would follow the following advances:
* Choosing the right location for the files (after I get a green light for the current developmental path).
* Extending other options in the wrapper for wiki_login's steps 2 and 3.
* Implementing cookie_manager with other user options.
* Writing help text and text cases, if any.
* Correction of existing work/ changing the stategy as adviced by mentor, or anyone else.
* Look into how can I use existing `base_url_transfer` class in the wrapper and resolve my query of the `HAVE_CURL` macro and shared pointers, etc. 

I am optimistic that I would be able to complete my first evaluation work by 25th May or so, as I will need to focus on my end term examinations after that which will start from 1 June. We don't get holidays in between the exams!

Please let me know if I am doing it the right way or not, by either replying to [this thread](http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/octave-maintainers/2018-04/msg00173.html) or by simply dropping a message on `#octave` for `<batterylow>`. All the suggestions are always welcomed.

Oh and not to forget, I got my [domain](https://batterylow.me) an SSL certificate, now all the requests are served via HTTPS only!

Stay tuned for next update.
